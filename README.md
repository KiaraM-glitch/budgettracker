# budgettracker

Updated budget tracker that includes offline functionality using indexed DB

The original budget tracker app was built to operate in an online-only environment. Users are able to enter a transaction name and the amount added or removed from the budget. When the transaction is sent, it is written to a MongoDB database collection and to the DOM as a transaction record.
